# My TicketSwap - Robert Langereis

*NOTE THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT*

This is the frontend webapp is a replica of Ticketswap (basic features), by Robert Langereis, as a final (individual) assignment for the Codaisseur Academy. We had 5 days to finish this final assignment. Dev tech used for this client-side webapp: 
- React / Redux
- JS/Node (incl. ES6)
- CSS

# How to run this webapp:
1. Install the dependencies using npm install
2. Use npm run start to start the webapp. 
3. NOTE: this requires a working server/backend. For this, see repository: https://github.com/robertlangereis/my-ticketswap-backend
